# DNN-Architecture-Reasearch

## Objective
This project is created for testing different architecture of deep learning neural networks. The architecture
means set of parameters such as:

1. Optimizers
2. Activation functions
3. Arrangement of the neurons in hidden layers
4. Number of hidden layers
5. Overall number of the neurons
6. Regularization techniques 
7. Learning rate 
8. Batch size

The final result of this project should provide us with information how those parameters influence the speed
and efficiency of the given architecture. Because of the obvious time-consuming calculation the combination
of the parameters won't be considered in this study. 

## Tools
Whole program will be written in python with use of:
- Python     3.9
- PyTorch    1.13.1
- Pandas     1.5.3
- OpenAI Gym 0.26.2
